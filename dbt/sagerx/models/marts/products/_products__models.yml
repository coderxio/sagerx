          Could be SCD, SBD, GPCK, BPCK, or null.

          A product related to the original brand product based on a clinical product identifier.

          Example: starting with a product TTY / RXCUI of SBD 1000000, you could have a related ndc_product
          of SBD 1000000 because that brand product relates to itself, as well as a related ndc_product of
          SCD 999996 which is the generic version of the same product.

          Can have duplicate RXCUIs if there are multiple NDCs related to that RXCUI.

          NOTE: this field is aggregated and pipe-delimited (' | '). It appears
          as though the MTHSPL data in RxNorm can have multiple
          product names for a given RXCUI. Since we are mostly concerned
          with NDC to UNII code, the names of the products as they
          exist in the MTHSPL SAB of RxNorm should be for quick reference
          and validation only.
