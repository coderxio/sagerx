    description: |
      RxNorm clinical product RXCUIs (SCD / GPCK) to MeSH codes,
      ICD-9 codes, ICD-10 codes, and SNOMED-CT codes.

      This table contains multiple different types of relations
      between these concepts, including `may_treat`, `may_prevent`,
      and `ci_with`.

      MeSH codes are more general and the other codes are more specific,
      allowing for a hierarchy if desired.

      RxClass is used for the relations between RxNorm RXCUIs and
      MeSH codes.

      UMLS is used for the relations between MeSH and the other types
      of codes.
