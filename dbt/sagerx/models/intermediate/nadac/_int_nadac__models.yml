      All pricing from NADAC with extra helper columns.

      We deduplicate rows - mostly by ignoring the as_of column.

      We add some useful helper columns:
      - end_date - when the price in this row ends (if historical)
      - is_first_price - is this the first price for this NDC?
      - is_last_price - is this the last price for this NDC?
      - dollar_change - the change in price from the previous price
      - percent_change - the change in price from the previous price
      - change_type - 1 if the price went up / 0 if no change / -1 if the price went down
      - a variety of columns for different lookbacks so it's easy to filter out older prices
    columns:
      - name: ndc
        description: The NDC11 of the product.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: ndc_description
        description: |
          The NADAC description of the product.

          If NADAC has 2 different descriptions of a given NDC
          over time, we take the one from the most recent release.
      - name: nadac_per_unit
        description: The NADAC (pricing / cost) per unit of the product.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: pricing_unit 
        description: The unit used for pricing (EA / GM / ML).
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: start_date
        description: The effective_date of the nadac_per_unit.
      - name: end_date
        description: |
          The date this price ends, if historical.

          If the price is the most recent price, this will be
          the most recent release date (as_of_date) + 7 days because
          presumably that price is valid until the next release which
          is weekly.

          For prices that are no longer in the current release, the most
          recent end_date will be 7 days after the most recent release
          where this price was included.

          For prices that change over time for a given NDC, this date will
          be the date the price changed.

        description: 1 if the price went up / 0 if no change / -1 if the price went down.
      - name: is_from_current_release
        description: |
          True if the pricing information for the given NDC is in
          the most recent release of NADAC.

  - name: int_nadac_pricing
    description: |
      Exactly the same columns as int_nadac_historical_pricing, but
      filtered to only include NADAC prices where last_price
      is true.

      This is essentially the most recent price for each NDC.

      There are columns to allow you to filter down to only
      last_price prices within 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days.
    columns:
      - name: ndc
        description: The NDC11 of the product.
        tests:
