          Crosswalk between select vocabularies in UMLS.

          https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/source-asserted-identifiers/crosswalk/

          Currently available:
            - MSH -> ICD9CM
            - MSH -> ICD10CM
            - MSH -> SNOMEDCT_US

          A common use case of the CUIs in the UMLS is as a sort of
          ‘bridge of synonymy’ between code sets. For a given 
          source-asserted code, the crosswalk endpoint will return 
          codes from other sources that have UMLS-asserted synonymy.
          It is important to note that the synonymy asserted by the 
          UMLS in the MRCONSO.RRF files (and the APIs derived from 
          them) has not been rigorously tested and maintained in 
          actual clinical care.
          
          With that disclaimer, users often have questions such as 
          ‘I have a code from vocabulary x, what is the equivalent 
          code from vocabulary y according to UMLS synonymy?’.
          Although UMLS CUIs can be used as a starting point, 
          results should be carefully reviewed for relevancy
          in your use case.
