              The partial URL for the detail about the shortage.
              Requires a prefix to be a complete URL. That prefix is
              `https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/current-shortages/`.
              Also, this field is weirdly camel-case for some reason
              (Drug-Shortage-Detail.aspx?id=123) even though the actual
              link it takes you to is all lower case.
