      All pricing from NADAC with extra helper columns.

      We deduplicate rows - mostly by ignoring the as_of column.

      We add some useful helper columns:
      - end_date - when the price in this row ends (if historical)
      - is_first_price - is this the first price for this NDC?
      - is_last_price - is this the last price for this NDC?
      - dollar_change - the change in price from the previous price
      - percent_change - the change in price from the previous price
      - change_type - 1 if the price went up / 0 if no change / -1 if the price went down
      - a variety of columns for different lookbacks so it's easy to filter out older prices

          The date this price ends, if historical.

          If the price is the most recent price, this will be
          NULL because there isn't a date when the price ends (yet).

  - name: int_nadac_pricing
    description: |
      Exactly the same columns as int_nadac_historical_pricing, but
      filtered to only include NADAC prices where last_price
      is true and is_within_365_days is true.

      This is essentially the most recent price for each NDC.

      There are columns to allow you to filter down to only
      last_price prices within 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days.
    columns:
      - name: ndc
        description: The NDC11 of the product.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
