          Could be SCD, SBD, GPCK, BPCK, or null.

          A product related to the original brand product based on a clinical product identifier.

          Example: starting with a product TTY / RXCUI of SBD 1000000, you could have a related ndc_product
          of SBD 1000000 because that brand product relates to itself, as well as a related ndc_product of
          SCD 999996 which is the generic version of the same product.

          Can have duplicate RXCUIs if there are multiple NDCs related to that RXCUI.
